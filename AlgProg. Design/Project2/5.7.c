//  Program to generate a table of prime numbers
/*
 * Program 5.10 has several inefficiencies. 
 * One inefficiency results from checking even numbers. 
 * Because it is obvious that any even number greater 
 * than 2 cannot be prime, the program could simply skip 
 * all even numbers as possible primes and as possible divisors. 
 * The inner for loop is also inefficient because the value of p 
 * is always divided by all values of d from 2 through pâˆ’1. This 
 * inefficiency could be avoided by adding a test for the value 
 * of isPrime in the conditions of the for loop. In this manner, 
 * the for loop could be set up to continue as long as no divisor 
 * was found and the value of d was less than p. Modify Program 5.10 
 * to incorporate these two changes. Then run the program to verify 
 * its operation. (Note: In Chapter 6, you discover even more efficient 
 * ways of generating prime numbers.)
